## 2 Connect to IoT Hub

### 2.1 Set Up Microsoft Azure Credentials

To run this sample, you must have a Microsoft Azure subscription and an IoT Hub. 

After you set up the subscription, you can create a hub. Log into the Azure Portal and follow these instructions to set up your hub.

### 2.2 Add your Device to the IoT Hub

To use an IoT Hub in an Azure Sphere application, you identify the IoT Hub that you plan to use and then add your device to that hub. The connected service retrieves the IoT Hub connection string and records it in a file named azure_iot_hub.c. The connected service then adds azure_iot_hub.c and the header file azure_iot_hub.h to your application.

Download **Mt3620AzureIoTHub4.zip** and extract it.
